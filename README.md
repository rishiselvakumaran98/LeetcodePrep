# Data_Structures_Algo

This repo is used for practicing and training for coding interviews. We are using this repo to first train for must know 150 Leetcode from Neetcode recommended prep. However more questions and folders will be added in the near future for further revision on DSA. 

The folders follow the Roadmap mentioned by [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). It is recommended to follow this prep to build better knowledge of the core DSA behind interview prep in Leetcode
