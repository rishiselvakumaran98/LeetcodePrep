This question tests the knowledge of Diameter of tree where 

Height of the tree --> H = 1 + max(left, right)
Diameter = L+R+(no.of edges = 2 [constant])



```
    This code calculates the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

    The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree recursively.

    The dfs function takes a root node as input and returns the height of the subtree rooted at that node. If the root is None, indicating an empty subtree, the function returns -1.

    The function then recursively calls dfs on the left and right child of the root to calculate the heights of the left and right subtrees.

    The variable res is a global variable that stores the current diameter of the tree. It is initialized with a single element list containing 0. In Python, passing this list as an argument allows us to modify its value inside the function.

    The line res[0] = max(res[0], 2+left+right) updates res with the maximum diameter found so far. The formula 2 + left + right represents the diameter of the root, where left and right are the heights of the left and right subtrees, respectively.

    Finally, the last line return res[0] returns the final diameter of the binary tree.
